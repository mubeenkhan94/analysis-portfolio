# Accessibility

Accessibility is a key part of the way I approach the world and my work. That means I include reasonable accommodations for visual-impairments, hearing-impairments, and other disabilities as best I can into all of my work. I make sure my creations work with screenreaders, have simple language where possible, are colorblind-friendly, and that the information in them can be communicated in different ways. In this folder, you will find resources from around the Web and of my own design that I use to help me with making my work accessible to everyone.
