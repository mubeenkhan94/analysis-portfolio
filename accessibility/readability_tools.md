# Readability Tools

I use these tools to help make sure that my work is readable and accessible to people of different reading and writing backgrounds.

## Hemingway Editor

This editor shows you what grade-level your writing is at. You can see if you need to make it simpler or more complex, depending on your audience.

## Webpage Readability

I use this website to parse web-pages I build (like flexdashboards) and evaluate their readability.

## Compatibility with Screenreaders

I use the following link as a general guide. I test visualizations I build using the screenreaders NVDA on Windows and VoiceOver on Mac if I am not 100% sure that the audience that will see it has any visual-impairments.
