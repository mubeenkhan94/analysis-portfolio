# Colorblind-Friendly Palettes

These palettes, courtesy of Martin Krzywinski, help me make sure that my visualizations and other presentations of information are accessible to people with that subset of impairments.

Martin has an excellent webpage [here](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/colorblind/palettes.mhtml#container) where he explains how he developed these palettes based on scientific research papers - you can find a lot more information there.
